Analysis of sugarcane yield and nitrogen application

Objectives: 
To analyze how the different rates of nitrogen applied in sugarcane has affected its yield and sugar content identifying the differences between different treatments (irrigation, cultivars, weather, time)

Methods:
This will be analyze in sugarcane data from Australia and Brasil and using data that cover more than 20 years 
Irrigation and cultivar variation are also factors that can change the response and are target of the analysis
