## DATA USE PROTOCOLS AND CONTACT INFORMATION

This is copied from page 7 of the Sugarbag Documentation (see [SUGARBAG-Booklet.pdf](https://github.com/ebimodeling/sugarbag/blob/master/SUGARBAG-Booklet.pdf?raw=true))

The SUGARBAG database system aims to protect the rights of individual scientists with regard to data
ownership and access. The agreed protocol is that each data owner should be consulted (via Di
Prestwidge, see below) before a dataset is used for an application.

The software should not be relied on as the sole basis to calculate specifications, data or formulations
where an incorrect calculation or result could result in injury to person or property.

The software has been developed to substantially comply with its specifications. However, errors may
exist. Therefore, the user has the final responsibility for the integrity of the software usage and its
results. It is the user’s responsibility to make their own assessment of the suitability of the software and
the accompanying material to achieve the user's intended results and for the use of results obtained from
the software.

Failure to carefully follow instructions for use of the software set out in the Technical Memorandum will
lead to output errors.
