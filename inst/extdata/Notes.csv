Experiments are in a Field. Fields at Sites and Sites in Regions,,,,,,,,
"A Field has a SoilType. Information about a Soiltype is found in Soils and for the layers of the soiltype, in SoilLayers.",,,,,,,,
The user can add as many and whatever soil attribute/s in the columns of Soils and SoilLayers Sheets,,,,,,,,
"In this example, I have used APSIM soil variables, but any can be used.",,,,,,,,
"In all cases, REMS will prompt if it cannot find the required information.",,,,,,,,
"For Example, when loading an experiment, if the Experiment Trait (eg max_evap) in the experiment file has not been loaded in the information file, a dialog window will be presented.",,,,,,,,
All information here can also be loaded using the Information Window. I.e. the user does not have to use this file.,,,,,,,,
